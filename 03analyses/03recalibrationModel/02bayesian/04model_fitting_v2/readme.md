# model fitting of the recalibration process

Model 01-03 have different decision stragegies.
Model 04-06 use the model averaging decision strategies, but differ in the updating process.

## 01 bayesian inference model with model averaging

## 02 bayesian inference model with model selection

## 03 bayesian inference model with model probability matching

## 04 bayesian inference model with posterior-weighting update

## 05 bayesian inference model with posterior-selecting update

## 06 fixed-ratio model
